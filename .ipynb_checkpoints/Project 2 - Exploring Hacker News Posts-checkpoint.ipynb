    "# Exploring Hacker News Posts\n",
    "\n",
    "We would be using Hacker News Data for our analysis. [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a social news website focusing on computer Science and enterpreneurship. It was started by the startup incubator [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Finding and Understanding Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "We took data set for hacker news post from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts/data#)\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set is Hacker News posts from the last 12 months (up to September 26 2016). It has 7 columns and the details about them could be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts/data#)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this guided project and analysis, it has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we will be doing a lot of analysis of data set and would be using the same code multiple times, I have created a lot of functions in the project. Everytime we are repeating a task or code, we can use the existing function, hence avoiding multiple lines of code. I am adding definitions and return type of the functions I created below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* explore_data(file, start, end) - used to display data **return None**\n",
    "    - file - list that we want to display\n",
    "    - start - starting index\n",
    "    - end - ending index\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* avg_of_col(dataset, index) - find the average number of comments or points for different posts **return average in float**\n",
    "    - dataset - Dataset for which you want to find the average of a particular column\n",
    "    - index - index of columns value in int that is use for average\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* value_by_hour(dataset, index) - find average number of posts and average number of comments or points for different posts by hour **return 2 dictionaries**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* avg_by_hour(dataset, index) - find average comments or points per post for different posts by hour, this is nested function and would call value_by_hour **return list of lists**\n",
    "    - post_by_hour - avg number of post per hour dictionary returned by value_by_hour dic\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* swap_sort(dataset) - This function would swap the average per post and then sort it before we display the results **return a list of lists** "
